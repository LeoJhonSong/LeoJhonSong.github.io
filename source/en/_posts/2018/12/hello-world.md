**Hi, here is LeoJhon.Song's first post!** I suppose the only reason you are here is that you have nothing else to do. :wink:  <div><sub><sub><sup><sup>or
because I shamefully wrote nothing else than this.</sup></sup></sub></sub></div>

OK. Finally, I build my own sweet little blog independent from annoy Chinese blog sites. It looks far much better don't it?

I plan to :one: **log my study experience** (I found posting my schedule could force me doing things which I intend to do but not do at last
because of laziness) and maybe some casual essay if I have the mood. It is really a good way to arrange your knowledge since there are too many small
pieces of knowledge nowadays. Besides, a most important reason is that I want to :two: **share the cool things** I found as **I find it tastes the
same with taking drug**.

I hope the future me won't forget this.
