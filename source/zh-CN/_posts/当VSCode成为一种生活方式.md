## [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

This extension includes nearly everything you need for Markdown, the only extra
stuff you need are [Reflow Markdown](#Reflow-Markdown) and [Markdown Emoji](#Markdown-Emoji).

## [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

This extension seems really powerful that it can do nearly everything you can
imagine of about Markdown. Unfortunately it seems that it don't support emojis
by itself in preview tab either. I have not tried this extension since I have
got `Markdown All in One`

## [Reflow Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marvhen.reflow-markdown)

This extension help you to do word-wrap very smartly by simply press
`Alt+Q` :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:  
**I LOVE THIS ONE!**
